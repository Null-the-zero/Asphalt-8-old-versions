This respository contains .apk files wich are only compatible with android.

Before using the file(s) you need to follow these steps:

1. First of all you need to extract the file(s).
On android:
Go to this link and download rar.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarlab.rar
Open Rar.
Now go to the Download folder and select the file(s) you need to extract.
Extract it.
And then install it.

1.1. If it's a file package that contains multiple files:
When extracted move the file package to /storage/emulated/0/Android/Data

1.2. If it's a .apk file and a .obb file:
You need to pair them by using APKCombo installer:
Download APKCombo installer: https://apkcombo.com/apkcombo-installer/com.apkcombo.app/
Open APKCombo installer.
Select the Download folder.
Select the .obb and the .apk file.
Install the application.

2. If you open the application and it needs to download files then let it download it.
If it's already downloaded, or finished downloading turn of wifi because it asks to update.

3. I cannot grant the original versions due to the installation errors.
Most of the versions shown here are mods (hacks).
